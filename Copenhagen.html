					<div class="col-md-6"><p><b>Amalienborg Palace</b> is the official city residence of Queen Margrethe II and the Danish Royal Family. It's unique in that the palace is made up of four former mansions facing a central square. The best time to visit Amalienborg is at noon to witness the Changing of the Guard. Every day, members of the Royal Life Guard march through the city from their barracks to the palace to take over the watch..</p></div>

					<p><b>Harry's Place and Døp</b> or Døp for short, is a humble hotdog stand. Next to the Round Tower in the city centre, it serves grilled pork and beef sausages with buns made from slow-fermented sourdough bread and linseed. If you prefer the more classic variety of hotdog stalls, this place is an absolute gem. It's been in business for more than 50 years and has the endorsement of at least two former prime ministers!</p>

					<p><b>Herman at Nimb</b>, a gastro complex on the edges of the Tivoli gardens. The chef references a lot of classic Danish dishes in his explorative menu. Here the lunchbox classic leverpostej (liver pate) gets a glamorous foie gras makeover. Nimb also houses a brasserie overlooking the amusement park, so you can watch daredevils doing gravity-defining spins while you are munching.</p>

					<p><b>Mêlée</b> is not a Danish option. The rugby-themed decorations or the hearty French classics, such as daube and onglet steak, on the menu at Mêlée. However, it would be a crime to leave this intimate 40-seater restaurant out of the list of Copenhagen eateries. The food is refreshingly honest and the atmosphere is homely and relaxed. The menu changes monthly but look out for the scrumptious veal and lamb stews served in small pots at the table.</p>
