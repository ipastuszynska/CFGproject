					<div class="col-md-6"><p><b>Island Hopping</b> is very easy to do once in the Canary Islands, especially since Gran Canaria, as the capital, is so well-connected. There are seven islands in total: Gran Canaria, Tenerife, La Palma, Fuerte Ventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, and Lanzarote. These islands boast everything from beautiful mountains to stunning beaches. Traveliing by boat is the better option, because you can bring along your car.</p></div>

						<p><b>Playa del Ingles</b> is a sea resort located on the south coast of the island. It is a popular destination for travellers because of the many seaside hotels and bustling restaurants in the area. However, the beach specifically, is the main attraction.

					<div class="col-md-6"><p><b>Town Hopping</b> is a fantastic way to spend the day. Start from Sorrento and take the boat all way down the coast passing through: Positano, Ravello, Minori, and Salerno to name a few. The scenery is incredibly stunning and inspirational for composers, artists and moviemakers, and just about anyone else. The setting is so incredibly stunning that National Geographic considers the drive one of its ultimate road trips.</p></div>

						<p><b>Capri</b>, an island in Italy’s Bay of Naples, is famed for its rugged landscape, upscale hotels and shopping, from designer fashions to limoncello and handmade leather sandals. One of its best-known natural sites is the Blue Grotto, a dark cavern where the sea glows electric blue, due to sunlight passing through an underwater cave. In summer, the dramatic, cove-studded coastline draws many yachts.</p>

						<p><b>Pompeii</b> is a vast archaeological site in southern Italy’s Campania region, near the coast of the Bay of Naples. Once a thriving and sophisticated Roman city, Pompeii was buried under meters of ash and pumice after the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The preserved site features excavated ruins of streets and houses that visitors can freely explore.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p><b>Il Ritrovo</b> is your classic Italian fare done right. Because of its elevated location, the restaurant is difficult to reach. Simply give them a call when you arrive in Positano’s city center and they will accompany you there and back. Seating is available on a lovely terrace surrounded by greenery, facing the sea. And of course, ending your meal with Limoncello will wake you from your impending food coma!</p>

					<p><b>G.A.S. Bar</b> has a tobacco shop interior, and they refer to themselves as an American bar. Climb up to their patio for a spectacular view of the coast alongside locals sipping espresso and playing Scopa. To beat the heat, the staf recommends their crema di caffè, which is like a Starbucks Frappuccino but better. In the evening, G.A.S. Bar turns into a restaurant with pizza starting at €3!</p>

					<p><b>Mimì Bar Pizzeria</b> is known for its lemon specialties - their slogan is “Save Water, Drink Limoncello,” so you know they’re not joking around! Pair your meal with one of their signature citrus cocktails (Limoncello Cosmopolitan, anyone?). It’s all about lemons in this region, so be sure to try as many dishes that feature the ingredient as possible.</p>
